# GestureSignTricked
A prebuilt collection of actions for GestureSign.

# Thumb Switching
  One outstanding option the software provides is the trigger conditions based on fingers initial or final position. Skipping the talks, the problem was following: I adore the horizontal 2â€¢ scrolling to switch tabs, however without the trigger conditions specified, even the vertical scrolls are detected.
  Pretty much the solution comes down to distinguishing between scrolling and tab switching.
  An ideal (personally speaking) solution is to limit where one of the fingers has to act in order for the overall activity to be detected as switching. And it's pretty much mechanically speaking just the same old scroll, but performed with a thumb and an index/middle finger, rather than index & middle together. This is honestly a marvelous trick for touchpad fans.
  
  Usage
  
  Download the .ges archive file and import it in your GestureSign installation from its "Options" tab (it's way at the end).
  You will see a couple gestures and actions appearing. Explore their contents to figure out how it works. Honestly speaking, I have no idea regarding the numerical thresholds, seems like their values are 0 to 1000. This conclusion has been made based on assuming the developer would consider different hardware devices support. Porting the gestures to another laptop actually showed no difference in end functionality. Enjoy and please let me know whether things are unclear, I'll throw you a couple support lines, no biggies. If you're a fan of touchpads and gestures, you ought to try this out. UX game-changer.
